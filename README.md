# MyntraHackerramp
website clone for our idea based on the theme of Increasing Engagement on a Shopping Platform

The concept of "Pin Your Style" draws inspiration from the Gen Z trend of using apps like Pinterest to explore and define their personal fashion preferences and make purchases.

Our prototype is built around three key components: Style Swipes, Pin Your Style, and Closet Cliques (Fashion Chats).

 Via Style Swipes we are melding the addictive swiping features of dating apps with fashion discovery. Users can express interest in an ensemble with a right swipe, seamlessly integrating e-commerce functionality by curating their Myntra feed according to the designs they swipe right on and avoiding those they swipe left on . It provides a fun way for GenZ fashion enthusiasts to curate their wardrobe with ease and style

Pin Your Style has been vastly influences by the app Pinterest and the framework it works on.
We aim to leverage this framework and enhance it with Myntra’s unique identity. By allowing users to click on styles they admire, they can access Myntra’s extensive collection of affordable clothing, enabling them to bring their pin boards to life. Additionally, we plan to integrate popular trends such as #AmazonFinds (seen on YouTube) and #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt, or in the Indian context, Reels, into Myntra’s platform.

Our third feature is made considering Gen Z's appreciation for authenticity and word-of-mouth information, we have introduced "Fashion Chats." This feature allows users to discuss trends, share links to their favorite purchases, and showcase hauls, thereby encouraging engagement and inspiring others to make purchases.
